The Classic TV Dinner

Swanson
Banquet
Freezer Queen

The term TV dinner is a genericized trademark originally used for a brand of packaged meal developed in 1953 by C.A. Swanson & Sons. Swanson stopped using the name "TV Dinner" in 1962; in the United States the term remains synonymous with any prepackaged dinner purchased frozen in a supermarket and heated at home.

The name TV dinner came from the shape of the tray it was served on. The main entr√©e was in a bigger compartment on one side of the tray and the vegetables lined up in smaller compartments on the other side.
